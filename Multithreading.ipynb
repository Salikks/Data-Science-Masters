    "# Multithreading in Python:\n",
    "# Multithreading is a technique that allows a single program to run multiple threads concurrently within the same process.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Why Multithreading is Used:\n",
    "# Python multithreading enables efficient utilization of the resources as the threads share the data space and memory.\n",
    "# Multithreading in Python allows the concurrent and parallel occurrence of various tasks.\n",
    "# It causes a reduction in time consumption or response time, thereby increasing the performance.\n",
