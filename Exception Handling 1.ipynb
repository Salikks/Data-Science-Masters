    "## Exception in Python:\n",
    "An exception in Python refers to an unexpected event or error that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting its normal flow. It is a mechanism provided by Python to handle errors and prevent the program from crashing abruptly. When an exceptional situation occurs, Python raises an exception, which is an object containing information about the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Difference\n",
    "A syntax error occurs when the structure of a program does not conform to the rules of the programming language. Syntax errors are usually detected by the compiler or interpreter when the program is being compiled or executed, and they prevent the program from running. Syntax errors are usually caused by mistakes in the source code, such as typos, omissions, or incorrect use of syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception is an abnormal event that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions are usually caused by runtime errors, such as dividing by zero, trying to access an element in an array with an out-of-bounds index, or trying to access a file that does not exist. Exceptions are not syntax errors, but they can still prevent the program from running if they are not handled properly."
