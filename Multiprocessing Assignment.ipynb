    "Multiprocessing: In multiprocessing, different processes run truly in parallel, taking advantage of multiple CPU cores. This is beneficial for tasks that require a lot of computational power, as each process can run independently. Each process has its own memory space, which prevents conflicts between tasks. This is useful when tasks need to be isolated from each other, such as complex simulations or data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading: Multithreading operates within a single process and shares the same memory space. However, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, only one thread can execute Python code at a time, which limits true parallel execution. Multithreading is more suited for tasks that involve I/O operations, like reading and writing files or network communication. Threads can wait for I/O operations without blocking the entire program."
